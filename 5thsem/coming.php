                Apple event on September 9, 2024. Apple Intelligence was the central focus of the event, especially with the new 
                Camera Control button adding Visual Intelligence features.
                The overall design remains consistent from the iPhone 15 generation, but the standard models have a vertical camera 
                bump for Spatial Video capture related to Apple Vision Pro. The colors are much more vibrant on standard models, while pro models get a new desert titanium option.
                In a rare move, Apple included the Camera Control button on every iPhone 16 model. It is a button with several inputs like touch, press, and swipe thanks to capacitive and force sensors.
                The A18 and A18 Pro bring a more advanced neural processing for Apple Intelligence. Apple calls the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro the first devices built from the ground up for Apple's AI tools.

        <h2>Xiaomi 15 series</h2>
        <p>  <a href="https://www.mi.com/global/about/" style="color: #ff6c00;">Xiaomi</a> 15 series will be one of the early phones with Snapdragon 8 Gen 4.
             It could also bring Android 15-based <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-15-hyperos-2-0-release-xiaomi-15-ultra-launch-report/" style="color: #ff6c00;">HyperOS 2.0</a> software with support
             for hidden camera detection, AI features, and other enhancements.

             <div class="img" style=" height:20rem; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
             <img src="./assets/coming/xiaomi.jpg" alt="img" style="height:20rem; display: flex; align-items: center;">
             </div>
             <br>

          The Xiaomi 15 Ultra will reportedly come with different back panels (leather, glass and ceramic options),
           a 2K quad-curved display, an ultrasonic under-display fingerprint reader, IP69 ingress protection, a 50MP
           main camera and a 200MP periscope zoom camera.
           The Xiaomi 15 Pro on the other hand may pack a 6,000mAh battery with 90W wired charging and 50W wireless charging (or 5,400mAh battery with 100W wired and wireless charging). It could also flaunt a 6.74-inch 2K 120Hz OLED display. 
           Meanwhile, the standard Xiaomi 15 may sport a <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-15-series-battery-design-tipped/" style="color: #ff6c00;">5,000mAh</a> cell. 
          </p>


        <h2>OnePlus 13</h2>
        <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus" style="color: #ff6c00;">OnePlus</a> 13 will be launching in October with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 SoC.
            Besides the chip, the OnePlus flagship could pack a 6.8-inch 8T LTPO micro-curved
           <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-13-boe-xsplay-confirmed-whats-new/" style="color: #ff6c00;">BOE X2</a>  display with 2K resolution.

             <div class="img" style=" height:20rem; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"><img src="./assets/coming/oneplus 13.jpg" alt="img" style="height:20rem; display: flex; align-items: center;"></div>
             <br>

          The phone may feature a 50MP Sony LYT-808 main camera, a 50MP Sony LYT-600
             ultrawide shooter, and a 50MP Sony LYT-600 periscope lens with 3x optical zoom. 
             Among other things, the OnePlus phone could pack a 6,000mAh battery with 100W fast
             charging, and an IP69 dust and water resistance rating.
          </p>


        <h2>Samsung Galaxy S25</h2>
        <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung" style="color: #ff6c00;">Samsung</a> Galaxy S25 is rumoured to use <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-snapdragon-8-gen-4-report/" style="color: #ff6c00;">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a>
             across the board. There could be a <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-s25-dlss-like-ai-upscaling-games/" style="color: #ff6c00;">DLSS-like AI upscaling</a> feature for games on this phone.
            The Galaxy S25 Ultra is said to be similar to the iPhone 16 Pro Max in <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-iphone-16-pro-max-similar-dimensions/" style="color: #ff6c00;">dimensions</a>. 
            The display might be narrower and larger than the <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-price-in-india" style="color: #ff6c00;">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.
            Subsequently, the newcomer could have more rounded edges. 

             <div class="img" style=" height:20rem; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"><img src="./assets/coming/SamsungS25.jpg" alt="img" style="height:20rem; display: flex; align-items: center;"></div>
             <br>

             Under the hood, the Galaxy S25 Ultra may ship with the same battery size and charging speed as its predecessor. 
             There is a rumour that the Galaxy S25 Ultra could be renamed to Galaxy S25 Note and Galaxy S25 Plus could be rebranded to Galaxy S25 Pro.
          </p>


        <h2>Redmi K80 Pro</h2>
        <p> Redmi K80 Pro will probably be another <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/xiaomi-mobile-price-list-in-india" style="color: #ff6c00;">Xiaomi</a> 
            phone with <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/redmi-k80-pro-display-chipset-tipped/" style="color: #ff6c00;">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> chipset. 
            The phone could also wield a 2K 120Hz display,
            an ultrasonic fingerprint reader, a 50MP 3x telephoto camera, and a 5,500mAh battery.
             
             <div class="img" style=" height:20rem; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"><img src="./assets/coming/Redmik80.jpg" alt="img" style="height:20rem; display: flex; align-items: center;"></div>
             <br>

             So with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 SoC, the Redmi K80 Pro could step up to flagship grade. Even in build, it could be high-end with a glass body and metallic frame.
          </p>


        <h2>iQOO 13</h2>
        <p> <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/iqoo-mobile-price-list-in-india" style="color: #ff6c00;">iQOO</a> 13 series is tipped to ship with Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 SoC. 
            The vanilla model could get a 1.5K flat display and the Pro model could sport a curved 2K display. 
            The iQOO 13 could have the <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/iqoo-13-tipped-strongest-boe-display/" style="color: #ff6c00;">strongest BOE display</a>strongest BOE display this year. This panel is said to be made using advanced light-emitting materials.
             
             <div class="img" style=" height:20rem; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"><img src="./assets/coming/iqoo.jpg" alt="img" style="height:20rem; display: flex; align-items: center;"></div>
             <br>

             Both phones might see a rise in battery sizes and charging speeds and could also feature an ultrasonic fingerprint reader.
             The iQOO 13 may potentially rock a 50MP triple camera setup, including a 3x zoom camera, and a 6,000mAh battery with 100W fast charging support.
             Besides the aforementioned phones, we are also expecting Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 phones like <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/asus-rog-phone-9-imei-specs-launch-timeline-expected/" style="color: #ff6c00;">ASUS ROG Phone 9</a>,
             <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/alleged-iqoo-13-realme-gt-7-pro-radio-certification-china/" style="color: #ff6c00;">Realme GT 7 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oppo-find-x8-pro-leaked-image-specifications/" 
             style="color: #ff6c00;">OPPO Find X8 Ultra</a>, etc.
